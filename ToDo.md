## IMPORTANT TODOs
- should let me know if DB stops becomming available. Don't just hang there.
	- make sure we get feedback if db couldn´t be created.
	- make sure we get feedback on any sql errors.
	- I get "{"error":"Connection failed: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Operation timed out"}" after too much time
- Should the menu really be generated by the backend?
- I shouldn't have visibility on projects (sidebar and not sidebar) I'm not user of ¿? does that make sense?
- From the sidebar, show:
	- DBs that are not being managed (should be actionable)
		- can't recreate them atm because they "already exist" so they just take up their name
	- project table entries that don't have a DB (need to be recreated)
- Any way to preserve db connection on a session?
	- find a way to not need the require_once to call db_connection. Check if the connection is open and to the desired db
- Project deletion should export to a dedicated "trash" folder first
- zip files and images should not have public links available, I need to secure them
- should be able to setup automatic imports from a git repo
	- project level or maker_mike level?
- https://www.nginx.com/blog/php-fpm-cve-2019-11043-vulnerability-nginx/
- should be able to modify permissions without having to recreate a project

### Import/Export
- 'tables' on project config should add in only what you CAN see.
- Maker_Mike level
	- Export
		- when you have no session, an 'undefined' file is downloaded
		- buttons
			- single angle down should select 't1' ... 'tn' on a project-level export
			- double angle down should select 'Select All' and then initiate a project-level export
			- use an ajax
	- Import
		- Actually called 'Create from File'
		- 0. Delete project if it exists
		- 1. Create Maker Mike project
		- 2. initiate a project-level import confirmation request and then import
		- add secondary form back in
- Project level
	- Export
		- what happens with more than 99 rows?
	- Import 
		- validate config to see if each table to be imported has matching column config
			- each import contains a config.json, parse it, extract the table object and compare it to the project's table conf.
		- on '?validate=true', provide a list of tables that will be written to, having checked write permissions on each table.
		- options (only what you have access to):
			- Complete file (no regen)
			- Pages
			- Themes
			- t1 ... tn

## General TODOs
- stateless computing
	- make sure project creation works on GCRun (simlinks, etc). Run should be stateless.
	- Config should be stored on the DB to keep Run stateless?
- annimations on both menus should probably match
- May move to GCP?
	- https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-run
	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-php
	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects#storage-upload-object-php
- theme autodeploy? filesystem watch service? support users to mount volumes?
- extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements?
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- encript passwords in db
- Revise logging, currently only using error_log
- SYNDICATION ?
	- I have a complete and a content_only export/import. Do I need a schema_only one?
- setup ace editor for php if it's not, can I have php autocompletions?
- check if page and theme url availability need adjustments due to case sensitivity
- verify session on pages from page table? would need to be able to mark pages as private as well
- use unlimited column types (will affect db creation) for html
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- create copy on edit
- only preview or don't show even don't show html field on datatable.
- should file size limit be a per project setting? (do I need per project settings?) same thing with input height threadholds
- create test suite
- incorporate OAuth 2.0 for Google accounts
- hide project specific disabled sidebar links 
- front end project config builder?
- use websockets?
- time column on projects?
- confirm project deletions
- dont use the light blue color on the plus/times button
- ctrl+s or cmd+s to save on ace editor
- tab to unfocus on ace editor
- CD? https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment
- get the logs (2 sources)
	- tail -f /var/log/apache2/php_errors.log
	- the normal ./start
- take jQuery out of the web app?
- verify the ace editor resize timeout
- Connect to Cloud SQL over private IP (doesn't look like it's possible yet)
- jQuery extension client library
	- client demonstration tool?
	- migrate the web app to use the JS client library
	- should the client handle authentication (get and set) as well?
- move images and files to gcs to make Run stateless

## Documentation TODOs
- front end recieves 5 pieces of data for each column: name, type, show, select, hide_in.
- Complete vs Content Export/Import feature as well as use cases or development patterns
- Diagrams
	- Content exports vs complete exports
	- YAML to JSON and JSON to YAML conversion on MM project creations (from scratch and copied from the datatable)
	- Import/Export feature
	- DB, MM DB entry and FS on project creation an deletion based on project name 
	- document config cache. Abreviated non associative yaml is passed on to PHP, which filles in defaults and stores it in the DB. PHP then reads it back and makes it associative. TODO where?, that then workes as a cache and at some point TODO configs are passed to the front end.
- Deploying to GCP (explain whole GCP migration). Should be using the "--prod-mode" flag on entry.sh
- document OAuth
- Creating portlets and pages
- Themes
	- can create a theme within another
- YAML config
	- "display: html" columns
	- Specify valid file extensions¿?
	- Permissions
		- defaults
		- dash vs 'dot star'
		- columns and table levels
	- _show fields
	- select: multi
	- select: tables (requires no type attribute)
	- booleans
	- text fields with 260+ length will be displayed as an ace editor on the front end as per web/src/js/script.js 
	- `user` and `user_type` tables are always added if they don´t exist, while `import`, `export`, `page`, `portlet` and `theme`are added if the database being created isn´t the maker_mike one.
- parameters
	- show paramter
	- where parameter
	- columns parameter
	- other?
- Cloud SQL
	- deployment script or steps
	- create Cloud SQL instance
	- authorize your network (if necessary)
	- use DB credentials on the docker run command
	$sudo docker run --rm -p 80:80 IMAGE_HASH /home/entry.sh -h 35.232.214.58 -P DB_PWD
