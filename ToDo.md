## IMPORTANT TODOs
- should let me know if DB stops becomming available. Don't just hang there.
	- make sure we get feedback if db couldn´t be created.
	- make sure we get feedback on any sql errors.
	- I get "{"error":"Connection failed: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Operation timed out"}" after too much time
- Should the menu really be generated by the backend?
- I shouldn't have visibility on projects (sidebar and not sidebar) I'm not user of ¿? does that make sense?
- From the sidebar, show:
	- DBs that are not being managed (should be actionable)
		- can't recreate them atm because they "already exist" so they just take up their name
	- project table entries that don't have a DB (need to be recreated)
- pass in portlet filters via the portlaet tag on a page
- Any way to preserve db connection on a session?
	- find a way to not need the require_once to call db_connection. Check if the connection is open and to the desired db
- Project deletion should export to a dedicated "trash" folder first
- zip files and images should not have public links available, I need to secure them
- should be able to setup automatic imports from a git repo
	- project level or maker_mike level?
- https://www.nginx.com/blog/php-fpm-cve-2019-11043-vulnerability-nginx/
- should be able to modify permissions without having to recreate a project
- exclude .DS_Store files on theme deployments
- add date field to blogEntry
	- export project
	- regen project
	- import modified version
- support dynamic arguments on portlet filters, for example for displaying an individual blog post
	- possible solutions
		- reading $_GET('id')
		- parameters left by other portlets
- portlets should be able to specify their field array
	- use `query_fields` instead of `query_tables`
		- update project.c.php
		- update page.php
		- update script.js
- on imports, when unselecting tables, the select all option should unselect itself. check backend validations.
- adding a user or user type on maker_mike displays more forms
- image name should be a link to the image?
- file columns should only preview file when they are images
- themes are not autodeploying after import
- check if old page symlinks are removed on page imports

### Import/Export
- Maker_Mike level
	- Import
		- Actually called 'Create from File'
		- 0. Delete project if it exists
		- 1. Create Maker Mike project
		- 2. initiate a project-level import confirmation request and then import
		- add secondary form back in
- Project level
	- Import 
		- on '?validate=true', provide a list of tables that will be written to, having checked write permissions on each table.
		
## General TODOs
- there is no verison locking on the php version https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php
- what happens if I delete a portlet that is being used by a page?
- stateless computing
	- make sure project creation works on GCRun (simlinks, etc). Run should be stateless.
	- Config should be stored on the DB to keep Run stateless?
- annimations on both menus should probably match
- May move to GCP?

	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-php
	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects#storage-upload-object-php
- theme autodeploy? filesystem watch service? support users to mount volumes?
- extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements?
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- encript passwords in db
- Revise logging, currently only using error_log
- SYNDICATION ?
	- I have a complete and a content_only export/import. Do I need a schema_only one?
- setup ace editor for php if it's not, can I have php autocompletions?
- check if page and theme url availability need adjustments due to case sensitivity
- verify session on pages from page table? would need to be able to mark pages as private as well
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- create copy on edit
- should file size limit be a per project setting? (do I need per project settings?) same thing with input height threadholds
- create test suite
- incorporate OAuth 2.0 for Google accounts
- hide project specific disabled sidebar links 
- front end project config builder?
- use websockets?
- time column on projects?
- confirm project deletions
- dont use the light blue color on the plus/times button
- ctrl+s or cmd+s to save on ace editor
- tab to unfocus on ace editor
- CD? https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment
- get the logs (2 sources)
	- tail -f /var/log/apache2/php_errors.log
	- the normal ./start
- take jQuery out of the web app?
- verify the ace editor resize timeout
- Connect to Cloud SQL over private IP (doesn't look like it's possible yet)
- jQuery extension client library
	- client demonstration tool?
	- migrate the web app to use the JS client library
	- should the client handle authentication (get and set) as well?
- move images and files to gcs to make Run stateless
- on installation
	- should create maker_mike folder and index and login phps
	- line 4 of session.inc.php makes php crash... php config is different, it doesn´t crash on my laptop 
- php does not have permissions to run all commands using exec()


## Documentation TODOs
- can I import an import file that has a completely different sql?
- front end recieves 5 pieces of data for each column: name, type, show, select, hide_in.
- Complete vs Content Export/Import feature as well as use cases or development patterns
- Diagrams
	- Content exports vs complete exports
	- YAML to JSON and JSON to YAML conversion on MM project creations (from scratch and copied from the datatable)
	- Import/Export feature
	- DB, MM DB entry and FS on project creation an deletion based on project name 
	- document config cache. Abreviated non associative yaml is passed on to PHP, which filles in defaults and stores it in the DB. PHP then reads it back and makes it associative. TODO where?, that then workes as a cache and at some point TODO configs are passed to the front end.
- Deploying to GCP (explain whole GCP migration). Should be using the "--prod-mode" flag on entry.sh
- document OAuth
- Creating portlets and pages
- Themes
	- can create a theme within another
- YAML config
	- "display: html" columns
	- Specify valid file extensions¿?
	- Permissions
		- defaults
		- dash vs 'dot star'
		- columns and table levels
	- _show fields
	- select: multi
	- select: tables (requires no type attribute)
	- `boolean` type
	- text fields with 260+ length will be displayed as an ace editor on the front end as per web/src/js/script.js 
	- `user` and `user_type` tables are always added if they don´t exist, while `import`, `export`, `page`, `portlet` and `theme`are added if the database being created isn´t the maker_mike one.
- parameters
	- show paramter
	- where parameter
	- columns parameter
	- other?
- Cloud SQL
	- deployment script or steps
	- create Cloud SQL instance
	- authorize your network (if necessary)
	- use DB credentials on the docker run command
	$sudo docker run --rm -p 80:80 IMAGE_HASH /home/entry.sh -h 35.232.214.58 -P DB_PWD
