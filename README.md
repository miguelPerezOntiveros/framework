## IMPORTANT TODOs
- Export/Import feature
	- Export
		- 1. SQL export (DML)
		- 2. Config from the project table in the maker_mike DB (this is JSON)
		- 3. Media report sheet (from all media columns, make a list of all referenced media files)
		- 4. Dump media files from media report sheet. Checking for consistency
		- 5. Deliver either an agregated file (compressed or not) or multiple downloads
		- Had not thought about extentions and themes
	- Project deletion should export to a dedicated "trash" folder first
	- Import
		- 1. Create Maker Mike project
		- 2. Dump media files
		- 3. SQL import (DML)
		- Had not thought about extentions and themes
	- Drag and drop imports
- stateless computing
	- make sure project creation works on GCRun (simlinks, etc). Run should be stateless.
	- Config should be stored on the DB to keep Run stateless?
- how does the CRUD interface handle different file extensions on file type columns? 
- should let me know if DB stops becomming available. Don't just hang there.
	- make sure we get feedback if db couldn´t be created.
	- make sure we get feedback on any sql errors.
- Should the menu really be generated by the backend?
- I shouldn't have visibility on projects (sidebar and not sidebar) I'm not user of ¿? does that make sense?
- sidebar changes state on window resize. Should it? if so, the query param should be replaced.
- move the copy as YAML implementation from the backend extention to the front end one at maker_mike.ext.js
- on project creator backend ext, don't add page and portlet tables to the maker_mike project (possibly no user and userTypes either? if not, then add those back to the project specific section of the sidebar)
- $ grep --include=\*.php 'TODO' -rn .
- I don't think I need a sidebar_project.php on each project, do I?
- From the sidebar, let me know what projects exist only on the DB but are not being managed.
- document dependency tree among php files
- should I close top nav when clicking on a tab?
- project conf is too large to fit on datatable

## General TODOs
- May move to GCP?
	- https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-run
	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-php
	- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects#storage-upload-object-php
- theme autodeploy? filesystem watch service? support users to mount volumes?
- extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements?
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- encript passwords in db
- Figure out a way to create content that is not published, sucerely (possibly the where parameter on the read service)
- Revise logging, currently only using error_log
- SYNDICATION ?
- setup ace editor for php if it's not, can I have php autocompletions?
- check if page and theme url availability need adjustments due to case sensitivity
- verify session on pages from page table? would need to be able to mark pages as private as well
- I need a better logo
- use unlimited column types (will affect db creation) for html
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- create copy on edit
- only preview or don't show even don't show html field on datatable.
- should file size limit be a per project setting? (do I need per project settings?) same thing with input height threadholds
- create test suite
- incorporate OAuth 2.0 for Google accounts
- hide project specific disabled sidebar links 
- front end project config builder?
- use websockets?
- time column on projects?
- confirm project deletions
- dont use the light blue color on the plus/times button
- ctrl+s or cmd+s to save on ace editor
- tab to unfocus on ace editor
- CD? https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment
- get the logs (2 sources)
	- tail -f /var/log/apache2/php_errors.log
	- the normal ./start
- take jQuery out of the web app?
- verify the ace editor resize timeout
- Connect to Cloud SQL over private IP (doesn't look like it's possible yet)
- jQuery extension client library
	- client demonstration tool?
	- migrate the web app to use the JS client library
	- should the client handle authentication (get and set) as well?
- move images and files to gcs to make Run stateless

## Documentation TODOs
- Diagrams

- document OAuth
- Creating portlets and pages
- Themes
	- can create a theme within another
- YAML config
	- Specify valid file extensions¿?
	- Permissions
		- defaults

		- columns and table levels
	- _show fields
	- select: multi
	- select: tables (requires no type attribute)
	- booleans
	- text fields with 260+ length will be displayed as an ace editor on the front end as per web/src/js/script.js 
- Cloud SQL
	- deployment script or steps
	- create Cloud SQL instance
	- authorize your network (if necessary)
	- use DB credentials on the docker run command
	$sudo docker run --rm -p 80:80 IMAGE_HASH /home/entry.sh -h 35.232.214.58 -P DB_PWD

## Maker Mike 1.0.2

### Running maker mike locally
To run on bare metal:
	./start.sh # will start mysql and php dev server.
- You should have mysql installed and available on your PATH ('/usr/local/mysql/bin' is typical on a mac)
- Check ./start.sh usage with "-h"

For docker:
	cd docker
	docker build .
	sudo docker run -v $PWD/..:/usr/share/nginx/html --rm -p 80:80 IMAGE_HASH /home/entry.sh -h DB_HOST -P DB_PWD

### CRUD service extension mechanism
The logic is written on the "src/ext.inc.php" file, which is required by all CRUD services:
- src/crud_create.php
- src/crud_read.php
- src/crud_update.php
- src/crud_delete.php

CRUD extentions are .php files named as either [TABLE_NAME].[POSTFIX].php if located in a specific project or [PROJECT_NAME|-].[POSTFIX].php if located in /src. The POSTFIX can be one of "c", "r, "u" and "d".
"src/ext.inc.php" will search for CRUD service extentions in 3 places in this order:
- project specific: /projects/[PROJECT_NAME]/admin/ext/[TABLE_NAME].[POSTFIX].php
- from "/src" with an unspecified project. Ex: "/src/-.theme.c.php" or "/src/-.page.u.php"
- from "/src" with a specific project. Ex: "/src/maker_mike.project.c.php"

### CRUD services' request origin check
CRUD services check if they have required by the backend itself by checking the $invoked_from_backend variable and then $GET_PARAMS and $POST_PARAMS if needed.
This is usefull so backend services can call each other without the need of new http requests while still being able to share their parameters.

### Discovery endpoint
"src/discovery.php" is copied over to each project at creation time by "./build_pre.sh". It returns JSON output with all the configuration data that the front end client needs to build itself. Security checks are made on the backend by "src/discovery.php".

### Transactions
Often times you will need a set of operations run agains the DB to be atomic. The should be run from the backend. This is an example. 
```
<?php 
	$invoked_from_backend = true;
	$GET_PARAMS['project'] = 'miguelp';
    $_GET = $GET_PARAMS;
	require_once $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"].'/src/load_config.php';
	require_once $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"].'/src/db_connection.inc.php';

    try {
    	$pdo->beginTransaction();

		$GET_PARAMS['table'] = 'award';
		require '../../src/crud_read.php';
		echo '<br>';

		$GET_PARAMS['table'] = 'link';
		require '../../src/crud_read.php';

		$POST_PARAMS['title'] = 'this is a title';
		$POST_PARAMS['description'] = 'this is a description';
		require '../../src/crud_create.php';

	    $POST_PARAMS['id'] = 4;
		$POST_PARAMS['description'] = 'this is the decription num 4';
		require '../../src/crud_update.php';

		require '../../src/crud_delete.php';

        $pdo->commit();
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        $pdo->rollBack();
        error_log('PDO ERROR: '.$e->getMessage());
        exit();
    }
?>
```

#### Recreating the main "maker_mike" project
- you will loose all project table entries on the maker tab, so projects will be in a limbo as the dabases will continue to exist
- run your maker_mike yaml on the maker tab, currently:
```
_projectName: maker_mike
_show: Maker Mike
project: 
  name: 
  config: 
    type: JSON 
  description:
settings:
  name:
  value: 
```
- run these extra commands needed to enable the home page:
	- ln -s ../../../src/maker_mike.home.php web/projects/maker_mike/admin/home.php
- delete the entry from the project table on the maker tab, the actual database will not be deleted as per blacklisting on backend extention maker_mike.project.d.php

#### start.sh
- checks if web port is free
- checks if db port is listening and restarts db if not
- creates start_settings.inc.php
- starts the php server and opens the url for you

### When you click 'submit' on the Maker 'projects' tab
- web/src/index.php sends the form data to itself (first transforming the config field data into json), which then:
	- runs ./build_pre.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables, which:
		- recreates the project folder
		- creates soft links to index, discovery and login.
		- creates individual upload folders for tables with files, and one for all service extensions
	- writes projectName/admin/config.inc.php
	- writes projectName/projectName.sql
	- runs ./build_post.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables, which
		- creates the database

## Front end

### Front end extention mechanisms
- Available hooks (2) on web/src/index.php TODO 
- Displaying HTML on page (display = 'html';) (see page.r.php and theme.r.php) TODO

### JS yaml library used
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs

## Notes
- To change mysql port: sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist
- One liner to find a string in all files recursively:
$ grep -rn . -e 'STRING'
- One liner to find a string in all php files:
$ grep --include=\*.php -rn . -e 'STRING'
- Clean docker out with:
docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm -f
docker images -q | xargs docker rmi -f
docker volume list -q | xargs docker volume rm -f
