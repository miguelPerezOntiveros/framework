# framework 1.5
### TODO
- extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements?
- reverse engineer sql dumps to my yaml syntax?
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- encript passwords in db
- make sure no sql injection is possible, use pdo's
- make sure we get feedback if db couldn´t be created.
- make sure we get feedback on any sql errors.
- add 'show' prop to individual columns, I can test that out with portlet tables
- address the todo's on index.php
- Figure out a way to create content that is not published, sucerely (possibly the where parameter on the read service)
- Change over to mysqli
- Revise logging, currently only using error_log
- Should the menu really be generated by the backend?
- close submenus on sidebar automatically?
- improve documentation
	- Document all php 'require' paths
	- Document extention files and hooks for front and backend
	- Displaying HTML on page (see page.r.php)
	- Creating portlets and pages
	- specify valid file extensions
- Log out should intuitivly log you out of what you want it to
- I shouldn't have visibility on projects I'm not user of ¿? does that make sense?
- How do I manage CMS-wide users?
- SYNDICATION
- verify session on pages from page table? would need to be able to mark pages as private as well
- maker_mike Import with drag and drop
- maker_mike Export should download a yaml file
- I need a better logo
- center form, issue on larger tables?
- support multi selects on the config
- use unlimited column types for html
- shouldnt be able to create a page that alrady exists
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- create copy on edit
- deletion of project could just move them to a separate folder?
- support input type text as well as textareas (for shorter inputs)
- rounded inputs everywhere
- only preview or don't show even don't show html field on datatable.
- support themes
	- prevent .. segments on creation
	- implement deletion
	- implement updates
	- implement reads? possibly a list of all files contained in the theme
- containerize this
	- choose between
		- Using RUN git clone ... in a Dockerfile and build the image each time the source code changes.
		- Get the source code to the host and use COPY . /whatever in the Dockerfile.
		- Get the source code to the host and use docker run -v $(pwd):/whatever/
- wrong error message on uploading heavy images


- git ls-files | xargs wc -l

#### Recreating the maker_mike project
- you will loose all project table entries on the maker tab, so they will be in a limbo as the dabases will continue to exist
- run your yaml on the maker tab
- run these extra commands needed to enable the home page:
	- cd projects/maker_mike/admin/
	- sudo ln -s /Users/miguel/git/framework/src/maker_mike.home.php .
	- sudo mv maker_mike.home.php home.php
- delete the entry from the project table on the maker tab, the actual database will not be deleted

### Running php dev server 
	./start.sh - will start mysql and php dev server
	you should have mysql installed on your mac and '/usr/local/mysql/bin' in your PATH

### JS yaml library used
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs

### When you run 'sudo ./start'
- the start script runs, check usage with -h

#### start.sh
- checks is web port is free
- checks if db port is listening and restarts db bif not
- creates start_settings.inc.php
- starts the php server and opens the url for you

### When you click 'Submit'
- index.php sends the form data to itself

#### index.php
- runs ./build_pre.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables
- writes projectName/admin/config.inc.php
- writes projectName/projectName.yml
- writes projectName/projectName.sql
- runs ./build_post.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables

#### build_pre.sh
- recreates the project folder
- creates soft links to index, login and viewer, and to page table service extenders.
- creates individual upload folders for tables with files, and one for all service extensions

#### build_post.sh
- creates database

### Notes
- To change mysql port: sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist
