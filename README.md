# framework 1.5
### TODO
- improve documentation
- I should look into extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- I should reverse engineer sql dumps to my yaml syntax
- change the user and user type table names to avoid collisions? 
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- open project in new tab?
- encript passwords in db
- make sure no sql injection is possile
- make sure we get feedback if db couldnÂ´t be created. PHP will know if the 3 inputs are not submited.
- make sure we get feedback on sql errors.
- add 'show' prop to individual columns
- address the todo's on index.php
- Figure out a way to create content that is not published sucerely (possibly the where parameter on the read service)
- Upgrade to bootstrap 4.0

- To change mysql port: sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist

### Running php dev server 
	./start.sh - will start mysql and php dev server
	you should have mysql installed on your mac and '/usr/local/mysql/bin' in your PATH

### JS yaml library used
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs

### When you run 'sudo ./start'
- the start script runs, check usage with -h

#### start.sh
- checks is web port is free
- checks if db port is listening and restarts db bif not
- creates start_settings.inc.php
- starts the php server and opens the url for you

### When you click 'Submit'
- index.php sends the form data to itself

#### index.php
- runs ./build_pre.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables
- writes projectName/admin/config.inc.php
- writes projectName/projectName.yml
- writes projectName/projectName.sql
- runs ./build_post.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables

#### build_pre.sh
- recreates folder projects/projectName/admin/uploads
- writes src/* files into it
- writes projects/projectName/admin/db_connection.inc.php
- writes projects/projectName/admin/session.inc.php
- creates individual upload folders for tables with files

#### build_post.sh
- runs projects/projectName/projectName.sql against db
