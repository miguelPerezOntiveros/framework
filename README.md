# framework 1.5 - Maker Mike 1.0.1
### IMPORTANT TODO
- home page should load on a request to the root
- not able to write php pages at the momet from within the web console. Should I just use themes instead?
- Export feature
	- export YAML/JSON config
	- export DML
	- maker_mike Export should download a yaml file (or create an entire maker mike file with all files and whole db zipped in?)
	- deletion of project could just export them to a dedicated folder
	- what about files?
- Import feature
	- import YAML/JSON config
	- import DML
	- project setup (simlinks on Run, based on YAML/JSON config)
	- maker_mike Import with drag and drop?
	- what about files?
- Check if after login redirection, the landing page checks permissions properly
- Fix the allowed URL on OAuth

### TODO
- can't close the sidebar from the home page
- theme CI? filesystem watch service?
- Note: handy command: git ls-files | xargs wc -l
- extending the projects from within, issuing create table statements?
- should access to reference imply access to referenced column?
- encript passwords in db
- make sure we get feedback if db couldn´t be created.
- make sure we get feedback on any sql errors.
- address the todo's on index.php
- Figure out a way to create content that is not published, sucerely (possibly the where parameter on the read service)
- Revise logging, currently only using error_log
- Should the menu really be generated by the backend?
- improve documentation
	- document ./start parameters
	- Document all php 'require' paths
	- Extentions
		- Front
			- Available hooks
			- Displaying HTML on page (display = 'html';) (see page.r.php and theme.r.php)
		- Back
			- Available hooks
	- Creating portlets and pages
	- Themes
		- can create a theme within another
	- YAML conf file
		- Specify valid file extensions
		- Permissions
			- defaults
			- dash vs 'dot star'
		- _show fields
		- select: multi
		- select: tables (requires no type attribute)
		- booleans
	- Document calls to cruds
	- Cloud SQL
		- deployment script or steps
		- create Cloud SQL instance
		- authorize your network (if necessary)
		- use DB credentials on the docker run command $sudo docker run --rm -p 80:80 IMAGE_NUMBER /home/entry.sh -h 35.232.214.58 -P DB_PWD
	- backend transactions
```

- I shouldn't have visibility on projects I'm not user of ¿? does that make sense?
- SYNDICATION ?
- setup ace editor for php if it's not, can I have php autocompletions?
- check if page and theme url availability need adjustments due to case sensitivity
- verify session on pages from page table? would need to be able to mark pages as private as well
- I need a better logo
- use unlimited column types (will affect db creation) for html
- I should allow for back and forward browser button functionality at index.php (you can't currently reach the same tab you were on)
- create copy on edit
- only preview or don't show even don't show html field on datatable.
- should file size limit be a per project setting? (do I need per project settings?) same thing with input height threadholds
- create test suite
- incorporate OAuth 2.0 for Google accounts
- hide project specific disabled sidebar links 
- front end project config builder?
- use websockets?
- time column on projects?
- confirm project deletions
- refreshing a page should take sidebar state into account, even if it doesn't match the query param
- dont use the light blue color on the plus/times button
- ctrl+s or cmd+s to save on ace editor
- tab to unfocus on ace editor
- CD? https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment
- get the logs (2 sources)
	- tail -f /var/log/apache2/php_errors.log
	- the normal ./start
- take jQuery out of the web app?
- verify the ace editor resize timeout
- Connect to Cloud SQL over private IP (doesn't look like it's possible yet)
- jQuery extension client library
	- client demonstration tool?
	- migrate the web app to use the JS client library
	- should the client handle authentication (get and set) as well?
- config should be stored on the DB to keep Run stateless
- move images and files to gcs to make Run stateless

#### Recreating the maker_mike project
- note you will loose all project table entries on the maker tab, so projects will be in a limbo as the dabases will continue to exist
- run your maker_mike yaml on the maker tab, currently:
´
_projectName: maker_mike
_show: Maker Mike
project: 
  name: 
  config: 
    type: 2048 
  description:
settings:
  name:
  value: 
´
- run these extra commands needed to enable the home page:
	- cd projects/maker_mike/admin/
	- sudo ln -s /Users/miguel/git/framework/src/maker_mike.home.php .
	- sudo mv maker_mike.home.php home.php
- delete the entry from the project table on the maker tab, the actual database will not be deleted

### Running with docker
	cd docker
	docker build .
	docker run --env-file env.list -p 80:80 --rm IMAGE_NUM

### Running php dev server 
	./start.sh - will start mysql and php dev server
	you should have mysql installed on your mac and '/usr/local/mysql/bin' in your PATH

### JS yaml library used
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs

### When you run 'sudo ./start'
- the start script runs, check usage with -h

#### start.sh
- checks is web port is free
- checks if db port is listening and restarts db bif not
- creates start_settings.inc.php
- starts the php server and opens the url for you

### When you click 'Submit'
- index.php sends the form data to itself

#### index.php
- runs ./build_pre.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables
- writes projectName/admin/config.inc.php
- writes projectName/projectName.yml
- writes projectName/projectName.sql
- runs ./build_post.sh projectName db_host db_user db_pass imageTables

#### build_pre.sh
- recreates the project folder
- creates soft links to index, login and viewer, and to page table service extenders.
- creates individual upload folders for tables with files, and one for all service extensions

#### build_post.sh
- creates database

### Notes
- To change mysql port: sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist
